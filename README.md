# glimmer

> A pixel-art always-on desk widget. Custom firmware for the **GeekMagic
> SmallTV-Ultra** that rotates through glanceable channels — Antigravity / Codex
> usage, clock, weather, push cards — with crisp retro typography on a
> 240×240 panel.

## What it shows

| Channel | What |
|---|---|
| **Home** | At-a-glance clock + weather + Antigravity/Codex usage meters + 24-hour timeline |
| **Clock** | Big VT323 digital clock, day-of-week, greeting |
| **Weather Now** | Hero temp, feels/humidity/wind, 3-day mini cards |
| **5-day Forecast** | Range-bar rows showing min/max + condition |
| **Antigravity usage**| 5-hour window % + weekly % + reset countdowns (Blue theme) |
| **Codex usage** | Primary % + secondary % + credits/reset |
| **AI Today** | Combined Antigravity+Codex card |
| **Info** | IP / SSID / signal / uptime / heap / CPU / firmware |
| **Push cards** | One-shot notification cards via `POST /push` |

All channels render via region-based partial repaints — no flickering
between data updates.

## Quick start — flash the prebuilt binaries (no toolchain)

Every push to `main` is built by CI and published to the
**[`latest`](https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/tag/latest)**
release, so you don't need PlatformIO to flash a device:

```bash
# Grab the latest CI-built images
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/firmware.bin
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/littlefs.bin

# Flash a freshly-stocked SmallTV-Ultra (over your home LAN). Firmware FIRST:
DEVICE_IP=<find via arp or device screen>
curl -F "firmware=@firmware.bin"   http://$DEVICE_IP/update
curl -F "filesystem=@littlefs.bin" http://$DEVICE_IP/update

# Device reboots into glimmer's setup AP. Connect to "glimmer-setup" Wi-Fi
# (open, no password) and visit http://192.168.4.1/ to enter your home
# Wi-Fi credentials.
```

Want a specific release instead of the rolling latest? Each `v*` tag has its
own assets under **[Releases](https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases)**.

Prefer to build from source? See [Development](#development) below
(`pio run` + `pio run -t buildfs`).

For the full flashing dance (including the one-time "get the stock
firmware onto your Wi-Fi first" step), see **[FLASHING.md](./FLASHING.md)**.

## Hand this to Claude Code

You can let [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code) drive the flash for
you end-to-end — it will detect whether the device is brand-new (stock
firmware) or already on glimmer, walk you through joining the right
Wi-Fi AP, verify each step before continuing, build, OTA-flash, and
restore your config.

### From a clone of this repo

```
> /skill flash-device
```

### From anywhere (paste this prompt)

> Please flash glimmer firmware onto my GeekMagic SmallTV-Ultra.
> The skill at
> **https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/blob/main/.claude/skills/flash-device.md**
> has the full walkthrough — fetch it, then walk me through:
>
> 1. Detect device state (brand-new stock vs already on glimmer).
> 2. Help me join the correct Wi-Fi AP (`GIFTV` for stock,
>    `glimmer-setup` after first glimmer flash).
> 3. Verify connectivity at every step (curl `/api/state` etc.) —
>    don't assume; always confirm with me before each handoff.
> 4. Download the prebuilt `firmware.bin` + `littlefs.bin` from the
>    [`latest`](https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/firmware.bin)
>    release (no toolchain needed; build locally only for unpushed changes).
> 5. OTA-flash firmware first, then filesystem.
> 6. After full flash, restore my config from backup OR walk me
>    through first-time setup (Wi-Fi → tokens → channels → personalization).
>
> My device's current location: `<plugged in next to me / on the LAN at
> <ip>/glimmer.local>`. My laptop OS: `<macOS / Linux / Windows>`.

Claude will read the skill file, build the artifacts, and run the OTA
dance with you. Don't run any of the curl commands yourself unless
Claude asks — the order matters (always flash firmware first; filesystem
flash wipes `/config.json`, needs the AP-rejoin step to recover).

## Hardware

- **MCU**: ESP8266, 80–160 MHz, ~30 KB free RAM
- **Display**: 240×240 ST7789V IPS TFT (requires `invertDisplay(true)`)
- **Backlight**: PWM on GPIO5, **active-low** (0 = full bright, 1023 = off)
- **Flash**: 4 MB total → 3 MB sketch / 1 MB LittleFS (`eagle.flash.4m1m.ld`)
- **USB-C**: power only — no data wired to MCU
- **Network**: Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz only

### Known limitations

- ESP8266 BearSSL TLS is tight on heap — glimmer drops the VLW font
  cache before TLS calls (`Display::releaseFont()`). Don't add more
  long-lived heap allocations along the Antigravity/Codex fetch path.
- No PSRAM, no DMA double-buffer — channel rotation is a ~80 ms instant
  cut. Within-channel updates are region-based, smooth.
- Display panel needs the inversion bit; the web UI exposes
  `Invert colors` toggle in case a panel revision differs.

## Development

### Build

```bash
pio run -e nodemcuv2              # firmware
pio run -e nodemcuv2 -t buildfs   # filesystem
```

### Regenerate fonts

The repo ships with pre-built VLW bitmap fonts (`data/fonts/*.vlw`)
sized to match the design spec. To add a size or family, edit
`tools/genfonts.py`'s `FONT_MATRIX`, drop the TTF in `tools/ttf/`, and:

```bash
pip install freetype-py
python3 tools/genfonts.py
pio run -e nodemcuv2 -t buildfs
```

Or trigger via Claude Code:

```
> /skill regenerate-fonts
```

### Add a channel

1. Create `src/channels/ch_<name>.cpp` with `chXxxEnabled`, `chXxxDraw`,
   and (optional) `chXxxTick`.
2. Add a row to `kChannels[]` in `src/main.cpp`.
3. (Optional) Add a `showXxx` toggle in `src/core/storage.{h,cpp}`,
   `src/core/web.cpp`, and `data/web/index.html`.

See `src/channels/ch_clock.cpp` for the reference partial-redraw
implementation.

## Getting your tokens

glimmer reads your usage by querying the Antigravity user quota API and
chatgpt.com wham usage API.
You extract each credential from your local config or browser's DevTools, then **set it on
the Tokens page in the device web UI** — open `http://glimmer.local/` (or
`http://192.168.4.1/` while the device is in setup-AP mode) and go to
**Settings → Tokens**.

### Antigravity — Google OAuth Refresh Token

**Get it:**
Locate your local Antigravity OAuth token at:
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token`
Copy the `refresh_token` (`1//...`) or direct `access_token` (`ya29...`).

**Set it:**
Paste it on the Tokens page under **Antigravity → OAuth Refresh Token**. Glimmer will automatically exchange the refresh token with Google OAuth and keep it renewed!

### Codex — Bearer token + device ID

The token must come from a **`backend-api`** request, *not* a CDN/asset
request — CDN requests don't carry an `authorization` header.

**Get it:**

1. Open DevTools on `chatgpt.com` → **Network** tab
2. Filter for `backend-api` and click any request (conversations, usage, etc.)
3. From that request's headers, copy two values:
   - `authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci…` → everything after `Bearer ` is your **token**
   - `oai-device-id: …` → your **device ID**

**Set them:** paste both on the Tokens page under **Codex → Bearer token**
and **Device ID**.

> **Shortcut:** right-click the `backend-api` request → **Copy → Copy as
> cURL** and hand the whole curl to Claude Code — it pulls both values and
> pushes them to the device for you (`POST /api/settings`).

> **Note:** the Codex bearer token is short-lived (~24 h). When the Codex
> channel shows a `401`, repeat these steps with a fresh request. The Antigravity
> Google OAuth refresh token automatically renews its access token.

## Disclaimer — personal & educational use only

glimmer is shared for **personal experimentation and educational
purposes**.

It reads your own Antigravity and Codex usage by sending **your own
credentials** to endpoints used to power usage statistics.
**These endpoints may change without notice.**

By installing or modifying this firmware you accept full responsibility
for:

- Your own compliance with the relevant Terms of Service.
- Anything that happens on your own devices, accounts, or network.
- Securing your credentials — they are stored on the device's LittleFS
  partition in plaintext (the device runs on your home Wi-Fi behind
  your router).

This is a hobbyist project shared as-is, with no warranty, no support
guarantee, and no claim of fitness for any particular purpose. **Do not
