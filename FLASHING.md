# Flashing glimmer onto a GeekMagic SmallTV-Ultra

This flashes the firmware over Wi-Fi — no case opening, no soldering, no
USB-TTL adapter. The trick is to do the first flash over your **home LAN**,
not over the stock device's AP, because TCP backpressure on the
ESP8266's tiny buffers wedges curl mid-upload over the slow AP.

## TL;DR

1. Get the stock firmware onto your home Wi-Fi (one-time).
2. Find the device's home-LAN IP.
3. Download the prebuilt images (no toolchain needed):
   `curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/littlefs.bin`
   `curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/firmware.bin`
4. `curl -F "firmware=@firmware.bin"   http://<device-ip>/update` (firmware **first**)
5. `curl -F "filesystem=@littlefs.bin" http://<device-ip>/update` (filesystem **second**)
6. Device boots into glimmer's setup AP. Connect to it once to enter
   your real Wi-Fi credentials.

That's it. (Prefer to build from source? See Step 3, Option B.)

Already running glimmer? See
[Updating a device that already runs glimmer](#updating-a-device-that-already-runs-glimmer)
— it keeps your settings and never drops to the setup AP.

## Step 1 — Bring the SmallTV onto your home Wi-Fi (one-time, stock firmware)

If the device is brand-new it will boot into stock-firmware AP mode.
The stock AP is named **`GIFTV`** (open, no password).

If your device has stale Wi-Fi credentials, factory-reset by power-cycling
three times: plug in, watch the progress bar start, unplug immediately,
repeat. On the third boot the stock firmware enters AP mode with cleared
settings.

1. Connect a phone or laptop to **`GIFTV`** (your captive portal may
   complain about "no internet" — ignore).
2. Open `http://192.168.4.1/` in a browser.
3. Click **Scan**, pick your home Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz only on stock), enter
   the password, save. Device reboots and joins your network.
4. Confirm the device shows its home-LAN IP on screen.

> Note: the stock firmware serves saved Wi-Fi creds in plaintext at
> `GET http://192.168.4.1/config.json`. glimmer's `GET /api/settings` masks
> secrets, but its `GET /api/export` (the backup) returns the full config
> **including** the Wi-Fi password and keys, without auth — keep the device
> on a trusted LAN and treat backups as secrets.

---

## Step 2 — Find the device's IP

From macOS:

```bash
# Refresh ARP cache, then look for the SmallTV
for i in $(seq 1 254); do ping -c 1 -W 100 -t 1 192.168.0.$i &>/dev/null & done; wait
arp -an | grep -iE "78:21:84|24:6f:28|30:ae:a4|94:b9:7e|cc:50:e3"
```

Or use the screen — stock firmware shows the IP in small text at the bottom.

Linux:

```bash
arp -a | grep -iE "espressif|78:21:84|24:6f:28"
# or
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
```

## Step 3 — Get the glimmer images

### Option A — download the prebuilt binaries (recommended, no toolchain)

CI builds every push to `main` and publishes the images to the rolling
[`latest`](https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/tag/latest) release.
Grab them into your working directory:

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/littlefs.bin
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/firmware.bin
```

For a pinned version instead of the rolling latest, use a `v*` release's
assets (when one exists):
`https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/firmware.bin`.

### Option B — build from source (for developers)

```bash
cd <repo>
pio run -e nodemcuv2              # builds firmware.bin
pio run -e nodemcuv2 -t buildfs   # builds littlefs.bin (fonts + web UI)
```

Both artifacts land in `.pio/build/nodemcuv2/`. If PlatformIO isn't
installed: `brew install platformio` (macOS) or `pipx install platformio`.

## Step 4 — Flash glimmer

> [!CAUTION]
> **Order matters: ALWAYS flash firmware.bin FIRST!**
> NEVER flash `filesystem` before `firmware` on a device running stock GeekMagic firmware (or any other non-glimmer firmware).
> Stock firmware looks for its own files in LittleFS (`/config.json`, `/Alibaba20.vlw`). Overwriting the filesystem first causes the stock firmware to panic and crash (Exception 28 Panic / infinite bootloop), losing Wi-Fi and bricking OTA functionality!
> Flashing `firmware.bin` first allows glimmer to boot up safely, connect to Wi-Fi (or setup AP), and smoothly receive the `littlefs.bin` upload.

The commands below assume **Option A** (binaries in your current directory).
For **Option B**, point the paths at `.pio/build/nodemcuv2/` instead.

```bash
DEVICE_IP=<your device's home-LAN IP>

# 1. Flash firmware FIRST:
curl -F "firmware=@firmware.bin" http://$DEVICE_IP/update
# Wait ~15s for the device to reboot into glimmer

# 2. Flash filesystem SECOND:
curl -F "filesystem=@littlefs.bin" http://$DEVICE_IP/update
# Or if device dropped into AP mode: http://192.168.4.1/update
```

### Hardware Serial Flashing (TTL / Unbricking)

If the device is bricked or you prefer flashing over hardware USB-TTL:
- Connect USB-TTL: `TX -> RX`, `RX -> TX`, `GND -> GND`, `3V3/5V -> VCC`, hold `GPIO0 -> GND` during power-on to enter bootloader mode.
- Use `esptool.py` to write both partitions at their respective flash offsets:
```bash
esptool.py --port <COM_PORT> --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin 0x300000 littlefs.bin
```

After both flashes complete, the device boots into glimmer.

## Step 5 — First-time setup (glimmer's AP)

After the first flash the device boots into AP mode:

- **AP SSID**: `glimmer-setup` (open, no password)
- **Setup page**: `http://192.168.4.1/`

Steps:

1. Connect your phone/laptop to `glimmer-setup`.
2. Open `http://192.168.4.1/` in a browser.
3. Wi-Fi tab — enter your home Wi-Fi SSID + password. Click **Save & Restart**.
4. Wait ~20 s. The device reboots and joins your home Wi-Fi.
5. Find it again (`arp -an` or `http://glimmer.local/` via mDNS).
6. Optional: enter Antigravity / Codex tokens, weather lat/lon, channel toggles
   on the respective tabs.

## Updating a device that already runs glimmer

Download the latest images (or build them, Option B):

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/firmware.bin
curl -L -O https://github.com/Avinava/glimmer/releases/download/latest/littlefs.bin
```

**Firmware only** — keeps all settings. Enough unless fonts or the web UI
(`data/`) changed:

```bash
curl -F "firmware=@firmware.bin" http://<device-ip>/update
```

**Firmware + filesystem, keeping your settings (recommended).** A filesystem
flash replaces `/config.json`. Build the filesystem image with your device's
current config baked in, and the device reboots straight back onto your
Wi-Fi — no setup AP. Needs a repo checkout and PlatformIO:

```bash
IP=<device-ip>; S=$(mktemp -d)                    # scratch dir — holds secrets
curl -sf -o "$S/cfg.json" http://$IP/api/export
jq -e '.wifi_ssid' "$S/cfg.json"                  # must be the raw config
cp -R data "$S/fs" && cp "$S/cfg.json" "$S/fs/config.json"
pio run -e nodemcuv2
PLATFORMIO_DATA_DIR="$S/fs" pio run -e nodemcuv2 -t buildfs

curl -F "firmware=@.pio/build/nodemcuv2/firmware.bin"   http://$IP/update
# wait until http://$IP/api/state answers again, then:
curl -F "filesystem=@.pio/build/nodemcuv2/littlefs.bin" http://$IP/update

rm -rf "$S"                                       # delete the secrets copy
pio run -e nodemcuv2 -t buildfs                   # rebuild the normal image
```

If the export has camelCase keys with `"***"` values, the device had no saved
config — use the fallback below. Usage history and the weather cache are not
kept either way; they refill on their own.

**Fallback — restore through the setup AP** (prebuilt `littlefs.bin`, no
toolchain):

```bash
curl -s -o glimmer-config-backup.json http://<device-ip>/api/export   # contains secrets
curl -F "firmware=@firmware.bin"   http://<device-ip>/update
curl -F "filesystem=@littlefs.bin" http://<device-ip>/update
# device reboots into the open AP "glimmer-setup" — join it, then:
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-binary @glimmer-config-backup.json http://192.168.4.1/api/import
# it reboots onto your Wi-Fi; delete the backup file
```

You can also use the web UI's "Reboot" button instead of power-cycling.

## Acknowledgments to the original community work

The "OTA-only first flash" technique was a community discovery. The
widely-cited advice that you must use UART for the first flash is wrong
— it's wrong because everyone tried OTA over the stock device's slow
GIFTV AP, where TCP backpressure on the ESP8266's tiny buffers wedges
curl mid-upload. Over your **home LAN**, the same OTA finishes cleanly.
